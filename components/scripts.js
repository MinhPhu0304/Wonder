Auckland, like all city-regions, is being disrupted as a result of changing population demographics, societal norms and emerging technologies. These changes will create risks and opportunities for businesses, workers and communities. How quickly these impacts will affect Auckland will vary by industry. Some of our industries are responding to the forces of change; some are delaying their response due to various factors; while others have yet to experience the need for change. A new report by council-controlled organisation, Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED) examines how local businesses are preparing for the future of work and anticipates how the Auckland workforce will respond to change in the coming decade. Tech Futures Lab invites ATEED to present critical learnings specific to this city and discuss how technological disruption is changing the way we work in Auckland. Join Pam Ford, General Manager of Economic Development at ATEED along with General Manager at Tech Futures Lab, Sarah Hindle to unpack key findings and explore workforce trends crucial for Aucklanders to become future-ready in the face of technological disruption, changing skills needs and new ways of working.
